# GalacOS. An operating system made by a 16yr old.

## About this project.
This project was created as a portfolio project to show my skills. I am currently studying to become a professional software engineer and successfully start a company with my aspirations. The main focus of this project was to successfully compete in the 2020 hacktoberfest competition where, along with thousands of other developers, I was challenged into expanding the open source library on github.

### TODO's
* Complete basic kernel with additions of 'C'.
* Attempt to make a native compiler.
* Show that the operating system is functioning by creating an application using it and running it successfully.
